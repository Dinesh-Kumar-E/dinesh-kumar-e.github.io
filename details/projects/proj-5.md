# SafeJourney-AI

A driver drowsiness detection system using machine learning and computer vision.  
Processes live camera feeds to track facial landmarks—eye and mouth aspect ratios.  
Flags drowsiness when behavioral metrics cross defined thresholds.  
Live dashboard built with Dash/Plotly visualizes real-time data and alerts.  
Triggers audio warnings for safety when fatigue is detected.  
Optimized for high-resolution cameras and cross-platform operation.  
Modular codebase: facial analysis, prediction, alerting, and visualization modules.  
No network needed—full privacy and local processing.  
Designed for use in vehicles, with future support for more biometric sensors.
