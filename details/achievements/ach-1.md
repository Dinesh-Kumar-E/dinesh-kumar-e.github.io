### Winner - Smart India Hackathon 2024

Our team, **RisingPhoenix076**, emerged as winners of Smart India Hackathon 2024. We addressed the problem statement "Video call intercom based on analog/IP system with vibration sensor" (PS-1578), proposed by the Indian Sign Language Research And Training Centre (ISLRTC) under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.

This project holds a special place in our hearts as it is designed to empower individuals with hearing disabilities, making communication more accessible.

#### Our Solution
Our solution included:
- Two devices enabling internet-free video calls with conferencing support.
- Custom features like text-to-speech, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and unique lighting notifications.
- A dedicated SOS mode for emergencies.
- A wearable device for accepting and receiving calls remotely.

The jury from ISLRTC was incredibly supportive and encouraged us to develop this project into a market-ready product.
