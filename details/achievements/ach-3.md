### Research Paper: Water Quality Modeling

I am a co-author of the published research paper, "**Water Quality Parameters Modeling of Thamirabarani River**." This study analyzes the physical, chemical, and biological indicators of the river's water quality using advanced machine learning algorithms.

#### Methodology & Findings
We utilized data from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and applied several machine learning algorithms, including:
- Multiple-Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Random Forest

The **Random Forest** algorithm proved to be the most effective, achieving an accuracy of **96%**, offering valuable insights for policymakers and environmentalists.
