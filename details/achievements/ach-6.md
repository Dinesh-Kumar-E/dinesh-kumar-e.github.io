### 2nd Runner-Up - Data Sprint Hackathon

My team and I secured the **2nd runner-up** position in the "Data Sprint" hackathon, an intense 24-hour competition hosted by the Department of AI-DS at Sri Sairam Institute of Technology.

#### Project: Medical Chat AI
We developed a **Medical Chat AI** designed to assist users with health-related queries. The key features included:
- Advanced disease detection through image processing algorithms.
- Integrated text-to-speech support for accessibility.

This experience was a fantastic opportunity to push our limits, learn rapidly, and collaborate effectively under pressure.
