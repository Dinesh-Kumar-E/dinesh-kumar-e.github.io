# Dinesh Kumar E

> ML Engineer | Software Developer | Researcher

I’m Dinesh Kumar E, a curious builder who loves turning ideas into reality through code. From experimenting with machine learning and language models to building clean, efficient web solutions, I enjoy working at the intersection of research and development. I love to learn new technologies, solving real-world problems, and share my work with the community. Outside of projects, I’m always exploring ways to push boundaries, simplify complexity, and create meaningful impact.

## Projects

- [Research Flow](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/ResearchFlow): An interactive AI research agent designed to help users research companies and generate comprehensive account plans through natural conversation. Features autonomous research workflows, dynamic plan generation, RAG-based document analysis, and real-time data visualization using Mermaid.js.
- [No More Brainrot](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/No-More-Brainrot): A powerful **Firefox extension** that blocks addictive content like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, helping users reclaim their time from digital distractions. Features smart content blocking, statistics tracking, and customizable redirect URLs.
- [pyCHIP8-neo](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/pyCHIP8-neo): A modern **CHIP-8 emulator** built with Python and PyQt6, featuring a development GUI for debugging and ROM management. Supports classic games like Pong, Tetris, and includes step-by-step execution capabilities.
- [QuizBuzz](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/Quizbuzz): A modern, feature-rich **web-based quiz application** with retro aesthetics. Supports LaTeX math rendering, multi-select questions, real-time progress tracking, and includes tools for data management and slide generation.
- [WordleAI](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/WordleAI): An intelligent **Wordle solver** that uses entropy-based algorithms and elimination strategies to solve word puzzles optimally. Features both CLI interface and web-based visualization with real-time probability calculations.
- [SafeJourney-AI](https://github.com/Dinesh-Kumar-E/SafeJourney-AI): An advanced **driver drowsiness detection system** that uses machine learning and computer vision to analyze real-time camera feeds. Features facial landmark detection, EAR/MAR calculations, and live dashboard visualization.

## Research
